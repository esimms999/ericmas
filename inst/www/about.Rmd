##### Some background:

Ericmas is a celebration of the birth of Eric. It is a major festival every year and is eagerly awaited by millions. As is shown in the recent photo, above, the joy of Eric recieving gifts is a beautiful thing. Everyone wants to take part!
<br>
The tradition is to give a nice gift for each day of Ericmas, and to give a **SUPER NICE** gift for Ericmas Day. This app is provided in order to help people avoid shaming themselves by under-gifting.
