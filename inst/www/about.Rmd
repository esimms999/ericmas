          Ericmas is a celebration of the birth of Eric. It is a major festival every year and is eagerly awaited by many. As is shown in the recent photo, the joy of Eric receiving gifts is a beautiful thing. Everyone wants to take part!
<br><br>
          The tradition is to give a nice gift for each day of Ericmas, and to give a **SUPER NICE** gift for Ericmas Day. This app is provided in order to help people avoid beclowning and shaming themselves by under-gifting.
